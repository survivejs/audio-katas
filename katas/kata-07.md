# Kata 7 - Dataflow programming

The purpose of this kata is explore how [dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) can be used for audio creation.

## Learning aims

The minimal target of this kata is to understand the basic ideas behind dataflow programming and see its relationship to audio production:

* Setting up a visual graph
* Connecting the visual graph with Web Audio API

## Task

Complete the following:

1. Implement a graph editor on top of an existing library to define audio inputs, filters, and outputs within a window of its own
2. See how much of the existing work can be pushed with a graph. Could the existing system be modeled entirely using a graph?
3. Consider the pros and cons of dataflow programming. What possible ways exist for addressing the cons?
