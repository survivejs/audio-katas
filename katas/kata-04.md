# Kata 4 - Audio sampling

The purpose of this kata is to understand the concept of [sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)) and why it matters for audio processing.

## Learning aims

The minimal target of this kata is to get acquainted with the concept of sampling:

* Loading a sample
* Setting up multiple sampled instruments
* Understanding the basic theory behind sampling

## Task

Complete the following:

1. Set up a window where to load custom, sampled instruments
2. Define several custom instruments using samples. Piano and different types of drums (see [@teropa/drumkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teropa/drumkit)) are good examples. You could also try to introduce [Amen break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen_break).
3. Optional - Add an audio visualizer window to show the current waveform
4. Optional - Figure out where the standard 44100 Hz sampling frequency comes from and what the implications of this limit for signal processing
