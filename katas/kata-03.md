# Kata 3 - Musical keyboard

The purpose of this kata is to add a [musical keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_keyboard) to our DAW.

## Learning aims

The minimal target of this kata is to understand how to connect user input with the system to produce sounds:

* Setting up a musical keyboard to capture user input
* Understanding how notes are defined
* Understanding the value of abstractions like Tone.js

## Task

Complete the following:

1. Find a suitable premade keyboard component online and insert it to the DAW within a window of its own
2. Research how notes are defined using Web Audio API and connect your oscillator with the keyboard so that it is possible to play it
3. Refactor the implementation to use [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
4. Optional - Allow playing your musical keyboard with the keyboard of your machine
5. Optional - Look up the [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) standard and consider how you might use it to expand the system with a physical device
