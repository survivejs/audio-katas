# Kata 1 - Getting started

The purpose of this kata is to get a basic environment set up and the first piece of user interface in place. It is also about getting used to working in a kata way. The difficulty will ramp up soon enough.

The reference implementation for the katas has been implemented using vanilla DOM with a helper library or two. That said, you can use a proper UI framework instead if you are more comfortable with that approach. Especially Web Audio facing portions will be similar although likely some of the handling will be slightly different due to abstraction added by frameworks.

## Learning aims

The only aim of the first kata is to get a development setup going and get used to work with katas.

## Task

Complete the following:

1. Study the solution for the first kata and run it
2. Decide whether or not you want to build on it. You can also bring your own development setup. In that case, replicate the functionality visible in the starter (i.e., draggable windows).
